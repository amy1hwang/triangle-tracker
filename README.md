# description of program
Make a web page that allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all. Here are the definitions of each possibility:
*Equilateral: All sides are equal.
*Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.
*Scalene: No sides are equal.
*NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.

# program setup instructions
* Clone this repository.
* Open index.html, CSS stylesheets, scripts.js.
* Then open the webpage via a browser of your choice.
